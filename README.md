This is an Hands-on-Project. We will develop several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. 
This is just an estimate but should give us an objective idea of how much the car should cost.
Some questions we are interested in include the following:
1. do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?
2. do I know if I put a fair value on my car?
